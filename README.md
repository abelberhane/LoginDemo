# Login Demo

This project will just be my working demo to work out creating a login page with ASP.NET and C#. I have been reviewing the general idea
behind this project and know the direction I am moving in. I just had to stop for the moment and will be picking this back up shortly 
either today or something this weekend.

I worked on this for quite a bit before I realized that I do not have all of the features I need in my home computer to test this out. I was unable to view my progress and test it out. I needed to install some upgrades to Visual Studio and my Development suite to work with .Net and view ASP.Net in my computer. 

I received this error: error on line 1 at column 2: StartTag: invalid element name

After some googling and research, thats when I realized I did not have all the proper things installed to view and run the way that I do on my work computer. Lesson learned on why its important to work in the same environment or have it set up to be. Installing now.

Never the less, validation has been created to ensure the email is an email type, the passwords match and are hidden, the username is entered and country is selected. There is a reset button and I have created a submit button that provides a succesful message when the Login page has been submitted.
